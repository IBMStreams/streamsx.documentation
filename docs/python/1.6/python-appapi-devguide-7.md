If you are familiar with Streams Processing Language (SPL) and want instructions to use SPL composites and operators, use the [Streams-SPLToolkitsTutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/IBMStreams/sample.starter_notebooks/blob/latest/Streams-SPLToolkitsTutorial.ipynb) notebook.

This tutorial notebook includes all Python code cells that you need to perform the following tasks:

* Discover toolkits that are installed on the Streams build service
* Launch the SPL main composite
* Work with microservices
* Integrate SPL operators in a Python topology

You can modify the template cells as needed to create your own streams-processing applications.
