If you are using the IBM Streams add-on for IBM Cloud Pak for Data, your applications will be created with Python notebooks.

The **Rolling Average** sample notebook is a complete application that you can deploy to the IBM Streams add-on instance.

You can find this Streams notebook on the **Getting started** page in your IBM Cloud Pak for Data installation.

Follow these steps to [import and run the sample](https://docs-icpdata.mybluemix.net/docs/content/SSQNUZ_current/com.ibm.icpdata.doc/streams/streams-notebooks.html).
