**Developing applications in Java or Python**
In addition to Streams Processing Language (SPL) discussed in the following section, Streams applications can be created in Java and Python.
To get started with those languages, see these development guides:

* [Develop Streams Applications in Java](/streamsx.documentation/docs/java/java-appapi-devguide/)
* Develop Streams Applications in Python [latest](/streamsx.documentation/docs/python/1.6/python-appapi-devguide/)



## Getting started with SPL 
Run your first Streams application, "Hello, World!" using Streams Studio.

### Launch Streams Studio
**If you are using the Docker QSE:**
  * [Start a VNC session](http://localhost:4000/streamsx.documentation/docs/4.3/qse-install-docker/#vnc).

**If you are using the Native Streams installation:**
  * [Install Streams Studio](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCRJU_4.3.0/com.ibm.streams.install.doc/doc/tinstall-studio-linux.html)
  * [Install and launch Streams Studio](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCRJU_4.3.0/com.ibm.streams.install.doc/doc/tinstall-studio-linux.html)
  * [Download the sample application project](https://streams-github-samples.mybluemix.net/?get=Examples-for-beginners%2F001_hello_world_in_spl)

#### Import and run the applications
Watch this 2-minute walkthrough on importing and running your first Streams application.

*Note: this video does not have narration.*

### Developing for IBM Cloud Pak for Data
*Skip this section if you are not using IBM Cloud Pak for Data or Streams deployed in Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift.*


The concepts in this tutorial apply to developing for Streams v4.3. The video above showed launching an application to a local instance of Streams v4.3.

If your Streams instance is running in IBM Cloud Pak for Data or as a stand-alone deployment, the steps to launch the application are different. This is because you have Streams v5 or later.

To launch the application in Streams v5+:
- Compile the application as shown above
- Instead of launching it to the local instance, you need to submit the application manually using the Streams Console.

#### Submit the job using the Streams Console
1. You need to get the URL of the Streams Console for your Streams instance. 
   - **Find the URL for Streams add-on in IBM Cloud Pak for Data:**
     - From the navigation menu, click <strong>My instances</strong>.
     - Click the <strong>Provisioned Instances</strong> tab.
     - Find your Streams instance, and click **View details** from the context menu. Open the URL under **External console endpoint**.
       
   - **Find the URL for Streams stand-alone deployment:** [See the documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCRJU_5.2.0/com.ibm.streams.dev.doc/doc/find-dns-url.html#find-dns-url). Choose *finding the internal URL*  or *finding the external URL* depending on whether or not you will be accessing the Streams Console from within the Kubernetes cluster.


2. From the Streams Console, submit the job by clicking **Submit job**:
  <br/>
![submit job](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2015/11/streams-submit-job.png)

   * Browse to the location of the compiled application.  This will be a `.sab` file in the `output` folder of your project.

   * Set any parameters, and submit the application.


<h5>Streams Console Overview</h5>

The following animation shows some of the useful features of the Streams Console.

<img alt="app in streams console" src="/streamsx.documentation/images/python/view-in-console-python.gif" />


<br/><br/>
<h5>Viewing the applicationâ€™s logs</h5>
See application logs by going to the <strong>Log Viewer</strong>, which is opened from the menu options on the left.
<img alt="Streams console main" src="/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/console-main.jpg" />
<br/>
Next, expand the application, select the operator whose logs you want to inspect,  and click <strong>Console Log</strong>. Click <strong>Reload</strong> if no data appears.

<img alt="app logs" src="/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/operator-log.jpg" />
<br/>


<h3> More about the Streams Console</h3>
<br/>
See this <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/streams-console-overview/">article on Streamsdev for an overview of the Streams Console</a>.

You can follow the rest of the guides but keep these steps in mind for submitting applications for IBM Cloud Pak for Data.


### Developing applications by using Streams Processing Language (SPL)

Streams Processing Language is designed from the ground up for writing streaming applications.  To quickly get started, see the following resources:

* Start with the [Streams Quick Start Guide](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/?p=5686)
* [Streams Hands-on Lab](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/streams-lab-introduction/)
* [SPL Examples for Beginners](/streamsx.documentation/samples/)
* [Search our samples catalog](https://ibmstreams.github.io/samples/)

Streams is shipped with comprehensive development tooling.
