<a id="map"></a>

## Mapping Docker container directories to the local host file system
*(Optional, but recommended)*

During the Streams Quick Start Edition installation, you are
prompted to map two Docker directories,
`/home/streamsadmin/workspace` and `/home/streamsadmin/hostdir`, to
local host directories.

Because the container has limited space, in most cases the best option
is to map to external directories. Doing so will help prevent the
container from exceeding its internal disk limits and make it easier for
you to back up your project data and upgrade your Streams Docker
container in the future.

1.  Create a directory on your host machine where you can keep both
    mapped directories isolated from other host machine files. For
    example, you might create a directory called `mappedDockerFiles` in the home directory of your host machine:  

    `mkdir <HOME DIRECTORY>/mappedDockerFiles`

    Important: Do not map the Docker files directly to the top-level user home
    directory.

2.  Make note of the directory. You will provide it during the Quick Start Edition installation.

The installation creates the mapped directories in your local host
file system within  `mappedDockerFiles` for two directories, the
internal *workspace* and *hostdir* subdirectories. During
installation, you are prompted for the names that you want to use
under `~/mappedDockerFiles`.

The following explains the use of the two directories.
* The *workspace* directory:  Streams projects created using Streams Studio would be stored in  `/home/streamsadmin/workspace` on the Docker container. By mapping the *workspace* directory to a folder on your local host, the projects stored in `/home/streamsadmin/workspace` will be stored on the mapped workspace directory on your local host machine. Storing them here  instead of in the internal Docker container means that you can reuse this directory for easy recovery of your projects.  For example, if you later upgrade your Streams4Docker installation, you use the Import function of Streams Studio to import the projects from a previous Streams4Docker installation.   

* The *hostdir* directory: If this directory is mapped to the local host file system, it corresponds to `/home/streamsadmin/hostdir` in the Docker container. Use it to store files  that you want to share between your Docker container and your
local host. Keep any large files that are used in your Streams4Docker container
in this directory when possible, because files in this directory do not
use up space inside the Docker container.

## Download and install Streams Quick Start Edition
After you configure Docker and map your directories, you are ready to download and install Quick Start Edition.

You have two options:
 * [Download and install from Docker Hub](#hubinstall)
 * [Download the container manually](#manual)

<a id="hubinstall"></a>

### Download and install from Docker Hub
The following sections contain sample commands for downloading and installing Quick Start Edition from Docker Hub.

<a id="conf"></a>
## Configuring the hosts file

Streams operates by using a host name and
expects DNS to provide the conversion from host name to IP
address. Because Streams Quick Start Edition does not have a DNS server,
you can simulate one by using the `hosts` file.
Before you can access Streams Quick Start Edition, you must set the
`hosts` file to point the host name **streamsqse.localdomain** to the
127.0.0.1 loopback address.

<ul class="nav nav-tabs">
  <li class="active" ><a data-toggle="tab" href="#hosts-windows-0"> Windows</a></li>  
  <li ><a data-toggle="tab" href="#hosts-macos-linux-0">MacOS/Linux</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="tab-content">
<div id="hosts-windows-0" class="tab-pane fade in active">
<ol>
<li>
Open a text editor as an administrator. For example, for Notepad, find Notepad in your Windows menu, right-click it, and
    select **Run as Administrator**.
</li>
<li>Open <code>C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts</code>.
<p>Tip: Set the Notepad filename filter to "All Files" to see the `hosts`
file.</p>
</li>
<li>Append <code>streamsqse streamsqse.localdomain</code> to the line that has the
    loopback address. For example:
    <pre>
    127.0.0.1 localhost streamsqse streamsqse.localdomain
    </pre>
</li>
<li>
Save and close the file.
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id="hosts-macos-linux-0" class="tab-pane fade">

</li>
<li>Open <code>/etc/hosts</code>.
</li>
<li>Append <code>streamsqse streamsqse.localdomain</code> to the line that has the
    loopback address. For example:
    <pre>
    127.0.0.1 localhost streamsqse streamsqse.localdomain
    </pre>
</li>
<li>
Save and close the file.
</li>
</ol>
</div>  

</div>

<a id="vnc"></a>
## Accessing Streams Quick Start Edition with a VNC client

Use port **5905** to access Streams Quick Start Edition in the Docker
container with a VNC client.

1.  Open your VNC Client and connect to the VNC server:

    **streamsqse.localdomain:5905**

2.  When you are prompted for a password, enter:

    **passw0rd**

 The default user name for the Streams Console is **streamsadmin**.

 On the Streams desktop, access the Streams applications from the
 **Applications** menu.


 <a id="ssh"></a>
## Accessing Streams Quick Start Edition with Secure Shell (SSH)

You can use **ssh** to access the container by specifying the **streamsqse.localdomain** and using port **4022**. For example:

`ssh -p 4022 streamsadmin@streamsqse.localdomain`

By default, all passwords are **passw0rd** within an ssh session. If you
use the user name **streamsadmin** and you want to run a command
as **root**, you can use one of two methods:

-   **sudo \[command\]** Provide your **streamsadmin** password when you are
    prompted. You run commands by using **sudo** and return to streamsadmin ID
    after the command is completed.

-   **sudo su -** Provide your **streamsadmin** password when you are prompted.
    You will be logged in as **root**. To return to the **streamsadmin**
    user ID, enter: **exit**.

<a id="manage"></a>
## Managing the Docker container

The following commands are useful for managing your Docker container
with Streams Quick Start Edition.

### Opening a session on Docker

You can use the **attach** command or the **exec** command to open a
session on Docker.

The difference between the **attach** and **exec** commands is that the
**attach** command takes you into the main root session. The main root session which might be
busy doing other functions (for example, it might be in the process of
starting streams), which will prevent you from doing useful work, but
will allow for better troubleshooting in case of a problem. The
**exec** command opens a new separate root session.

**Attaching to a running Docker container**

1.  Open PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS or Linux).

2.  Determine the name of the session by entering **docker ps**. The container **streamsdocker4300** is displayed with a status of `running`.

3.  Attach to the container by entering this command:

    `docker attach streamsdocker4300`

    This command takes you to the Docker container Linux prompt.

**Running a command in a running container with the exec command**

Enter the Docker **exec** command:

  `docker exec -ti streamsdocker4300 /bin/bash`

### Detaching from the container

From within your attached Docker session, you can detach from the
session and still leave session active.

1. Use the appropriate key combination for your environment:
    -  Windows or Linux: **Ctrl-q-p**
    -  MacOS: **command-q-p**

    Important: If you are attached to a container and enter **exit**, it might cause the
container to stop.

2. (Optional) Close the PowerShell or Terminal session.

### Pausing and restarting the container

You can pause a container when it is not in use. The container pauses and all activity inside the container stops. You can unpause the container to use it again.

1.  If you are running external programs that are connected to the
    container, close them.

1.  From a PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS or Linux) session, enter the appropriate command:
    -   To pause the container:
        ```
        docker pause streamsdocker4300
        ```

    -   To unpause the container:
        ```
        docker unpause streamsdocker4300
        ```

### Stopping and restarting the container

Typically, you manage a container by pausing and unpausing it. But sometimes you might need to stop and restart the container, for
example, for a reboot.

From a PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS or Linux) session, enter the appropriate command:

-   To stop a container:

    ```
    docker stop streamsdocker4300
    ```

-   To restart a container:

    ```
    docker restart streamsdocker4300
    ```

    Tip: When a container is restarted, it takes a few minutes for the system to come back up and start the domains. To see the status, you can use
    VNC to access the desktop, where you can see the yellow desktop icon
    (Streams Domain Starting) while the domain is starting. The icon
    turns green (Streams Domain Started) when the domain is ready. The icon
    eventually disappears.

## Adjusting the desktop screen size for VNC

When you first access Streams Quick Start Edition with VNC, you will see
the Streams desktop.

If you are accustomed to earlier versions of Streams Quick Start
Edition, you will notice that there are no longer any desktop icons. All
Streams Quick Start Edition resources have been moved to the
**Applications \> Favorites** menu, which you can access from the top
left of the screen. There you will find the Streams applications and
links to resource web pages.

To adjust the display size to closer match your physical display, follow
these steps:

1.  Go to **Applications \> System Tools \> Settings**.

2.  Click **Devices > Displays**.

3.  In the **Displays** app, click **Resolution**.

4.   Select the resolution that best matches your physical display. Close the **Resolution** list by clicking 'x' in the corner.  Click **Apply**.

5.  Click **Keep Changes.**

## Known issues

#### **Description**: Running `streamsdockerInstall.sh` fails with the following message:

  PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
  streamsqse.localdomain     : ok=41   changed=32   unreachable=0    failed=1  
  ```

**Cause**: This might be caused by a change in the Python repositories.

**Workaround:**
1. In the Quick Start Edition installation directory, locate the `Ansible/streamsdockerCentos7.yaml` file and open it in a text editor.
1. Locate the following section:
    ```
    ######### Python Module installation ####################################

    name: install Streams prereq packages with yum
    pip: name={{item}} state=latest
    with_items:

    readline
    requests
    future
    dill
    ```
1. Change `requests` to `request`.
1. Save the file.
1. Remove the old container:
    ```
    docker stop streamsdocker4300
    docker rm streamsdocker4300
    ```
7. Reinstall Quick Start Edition.
