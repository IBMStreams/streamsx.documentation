/*
This example shows how to use the Streams C++ native function facility to recursively scan
a given directory and obtain the names of the files present. The logic for the recursive
directory scan polls the specified directory periodically and notifies the downstream 
operator with a new file that just appeared. There is a companion C++ project for this
SPL project. Please refer to the RecursiveDirScanLib project for the C++ logic.

Important sequence of logic for this application:

1) SPL code resolves the C++ native function in its native.function/function.xml file.
2) A call from the SPL code to the native function lands in the wrapper inline C++ functions
   defined in the RecursiveDirScanWrappers.h file of the companion C++ project.
3) From that wrapper function, it gets access to a singleton C++ object of the
   RecursiveDirScan class and then invokes the getFileNamesInDirectory C++ method.
4) When that C++ method returns, it will have the results stored in a list<string> reference that
   was passed to it.
5) Back in the SPL code, there is additional logic to cache the already seen files and to filter
   only the newly found files to send to the downstream operator.

Before doing anything with the SPL project, is is necessary to go and run the ./mk script
available in the companion C++ project (RecursiveDirScanLib). That script will compile the
C++ code to create shared object (.so) file that will be copied to the impl/lib directory of
the 050_recursive_dir_scan SPL project.


In order to test this application, please following these steps:

a) Ensure that the companion C++ project is built using the ./mk script in that project directory.
b) Ensure that the SPL project is built successfully.
c) Now, you can run the SPL application in standalone mode (either from a terminal window or inside 
   the Streams Studio)
d) From a terminal window, go to this SPL project directory and run the two test shell scripts that
   you will see there. (01_simulate_data_feeds.sh and 02_simulate_data_feeds.sh)
e) Observe the results being displayed on the console.
