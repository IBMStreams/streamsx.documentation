/*
This example shows how SPL provides rich support to generate synthetic data required for
large scale testing. Many real-life applications in the Telco and the Retail Banking
sectors consume large amounts of daily transaction data through CSV formatted text files.
There could be huge amounts of CDR data from several telecom circles or daily transaction
data for millions of accounts in a retail bank.

While building and testing SPL applications, it will become necessary to generate such
ingest data files with fake data that is somewhat realistic. This application shows
how such large amounts of data in several thousands of files can be created very quickly
using the SPL standard toolkit operators and the SPL built-in functions (file IO and math random).
