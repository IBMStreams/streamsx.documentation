/*
This example demonstrates one of the important features desired in the
real-world (mostly in the retail banking and in the telco industries).
In many real-world scenarios, they still work via files that get dropped
into a directory for processing. It is shown here how the DirectoryScan
operator picks up a file as soon as it appears inside an input directory.

namespace my.sample;
// In order to test this application, you have to ensure that three 
// sub-directories "test1", "test2", "test3" are present inside this application's directory.
// Then, you have to do the following:
// 1) Copy the data/Population.txt file to test1.
// 2) Copy the data/EmployeeRecords.txt file to test2.
// 3) Copy the data/DepartmentRecords.txt file to test3.
//
// In each of those three sub-directories (test1, test2, test3),
// keep copying the same file again and again in different filenames.
// Every new file you create there should be picked up by the DirectoryScan operator.
