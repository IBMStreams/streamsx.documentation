/*
This example shows how to launch/execute an external application within the Streams SPL code.
In this case, we defined a simple C++ native function in which we have the required C++ code to
launch an external application. That C++ code uses pipes to execute a given application.
This function would be useful to launch any custom script within the Streams application logic when
certain application specific conditions arise.
