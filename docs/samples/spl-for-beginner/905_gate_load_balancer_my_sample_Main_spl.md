// Implementing Load Balancing of Tuples

// A ThreadedSplit operator may be used to split a stream, 
// and process tuples in parallel.
// This works for many applications, but if the processing time of 
// a tuple varies considerably depending on the tuple data, it may 
// cause problems where a tuple with a long processing time may cause 
// subsequent tuples to be backed up in the stream waiting for processing,
// even though there may be another thread available and idle.
// This may be aggravated by tuples that are in a TCP/IP connection to 
// another PE. In order to ensure load balancing, a ThreadedSplit 
// operator with a buffer size of 1 may be tied to two or more Gate 
// operators with a maximum unacknowled tuple count of 1 or more.
// The ThreadedSplit and the  Gate operators must be on the same PE, to 
// avoid tuples queuing between PEs. A partitionColocation placement 
// config is used to ensure this.
//
// The Gate operator will allow only the specified number of tuples 
// (1 in this case)  to pass at a time.  It will wait until a 
// subsequent operator has acknowledged  receipt of the tuple before 
// passing the next tuple.  In this manner, no tuple will  ever be 
// queued behind another, waiting to be processed.
//

		} // End of I = Beacon()
		
		// Split the stream into 2 streams. Â Use a following Gate to ensure load balancing
