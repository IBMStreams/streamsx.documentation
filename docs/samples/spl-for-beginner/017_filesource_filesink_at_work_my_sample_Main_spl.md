/*
We have used the FileSource and the FileSink operators in other examples
before. However, this example shows off the following intriguing
features that will become handy. 

a) Automatic deletion of a file after the FileSource reads all the records.
b) Flushing the sink file on demand after writing a certain number of tuples.
c) Ability of the FileSource to move the file once it is done with it.
d) Creating a fresh and new output sink file after writing certain number of tuples.
e) Ability of the FileSource to keep reading from a hot file as new CSV records get written.

// To test the hotFile function, you have to keep appending new records
