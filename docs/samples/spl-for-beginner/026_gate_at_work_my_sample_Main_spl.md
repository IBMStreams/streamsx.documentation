/*
This is an example that uses the Gate operator from the standard toolkit.
This operator delays the incoming tuples until a downstream operator 
signals with an acknowledgment to receive any further tuples. This is 
a great way to have a feedback through which we can control the rate at
which tuples are passed through. (Please refer to another example
named 905_gate_load_balancer that shows the effectiveness of the Gate
operator in combination with the ThreadedSplit operator to provide
load balancing of the incoming tuples.
