/*
This example shows a simple method for converting "tuple data to JSON" and 
"JSON data to tuple". In this example, this conversion is done using C++ code.
There is another example (049_json_to_tuple_to_json_using_java) that shows the
same technique using Java. 

This particular example was added just to give the users a flavor of doing this
conversion using C++ rather than using Java. There is a general belief that code
written using C++ tends to perform better than the same logic written using Java.
Users can decide what works better for them regarding the choice between C++ and Java.

In this example, two C++ native functions will provide a way to convert tuples into
JSON data and convert JSON data into SPL tuples. You can refer to the native function
model XML file about these two functions. Refer to ../../impl/include/Functions.h file for
the implementation of these two functions.

Important Note
--------------
This example will require an open source component called CAJUN - C++ API for JSON.
To avoid the code redistribution issues, this example is not packaged with that open source component.
That component is available from sourceforge with a BSD license. If your work environment doesn't 
permit you to download the BSD licensed open source components, then you can't run this example.
If the CAJUN BSD licensing policy is acceptable for your needs, then you can download the
CAJUN component by following the instructions shown below and store it as part of this SPL project
directory. 

1) Download cajun-2.0.2.zip from this URL and store it inside the home directory of your Linux system.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/cajun-jsonapi/files/latest/download

2) Unzip the cajun-2.0.2.zip file inside the home directory of your Linux system.
   Following command will create a directory named "cajun-2.0.2".

cd ~/
unzip cajun-2.0.2.zip

3) Move the json directory from the cajun-2.0.2 directory into this project directory as shown below.
   (Following command assumes that your SPL examples directory is in your home directory. If not,
    you have to modify the following command as needed.)
    
mv ~/cajun-2.0.2/json   ~/SPL-Examples-For-Beginners/055_json_to_tuple_to_json_using_c++/impl/include

4) You can carefully delete the cajun-2.0.2 directory.

rm -r ~/cajun-2.0.2

5) As mentioned above, this example has default code that does dummy conversion to avoid any
open source code redistribution issues. If you want to do a real Tuple<-->JSON conversion, 
then you must perform the 4 steps mentioned above. After that, you have to edit the following file.

a) ~/SPL-Examples-For-Beginners/055_json_to_tuple_to_json_using_c++/impl/include/Functions.h
b) Inside that file, search for  this string:  #define CAJUN_API_AVAILABLE
c) If the line with that string is commented out, you have to uncomment that line and save the file.
d) You have to build the project now either inside the Streams Studio or from a command line.
e) While compiling, you will notice the following two C++ compiler errors.

../../.././impl/include/json/reader.inl:323:45: error: incomplete universal character name \u
../../.././impl/include/json/writer.inl:151:15: error: incomplete universal character name \u 

f) To resolve those two errors, open those two CAJUN API source files shown as part of the compiler errors.
g) Go to the indicated lines in the errors, and comment those two erroneous lines and save the two files.
h) At this time, do a full clean of the SPL project and then rebuild the SPL project.
i) Now, it should compile correctly with no errors.
j) If you run the application, it will perform the required Tuple<-->JSON conversions using 
   the CAJUN API you downloaded and configured.
