You can use the Beam [metrics API](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/metrics/package-summary.html) to insert information to monitor your IBM Streams Runner for Apache Beam application. This document uses the `TemperatureSample` application that is included in IBM Streams Runner for Apache Beam to show how Streams Runner makes metrics available for monitoring, both to the application itself and other monitoring tools.

## Adding metrics to your application

Beam supports two basic types of metrics:

- A [Counter](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/metrics/Counter.html) metric reports a single long value and can be incremented or decremented.
- A [Distribution](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/metrics/Distribution.html) metric holds information about the distribution of reported long values. A [gauge](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/metrics/Gauge.html) metric holds a long value that can be set and a timestamp of the last change.

Steps in the Beam application's processing pipeline can create and update metrics that are associated with that step. To do so, during processing the application calls [Metrics.counter()](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/metrics/Metrics.html#counter-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-), [Metrics.distribution()](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/metrics/Metrics.html#distribution-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-), or [Metrics.gauge()](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/metrics/Metrics.html#gauge-java.lang.String-java.lang.String) to get a named metric and then update it.

For example, in the `TemperatureSample.main()` method, in the processing for the `ValidateReadings` operation, the code updates two distribution metrics when a value is valid or two counters when a value is not valid:

```
if (temp &lt; badTempThreshold) {
    // Good reading, output and update distribution metrics
    c.output(c.element());
    long roundedTemp = Math.round(temp);
    Metrics.distribution(COLLECTED\_METRIC\_NAMESPACE, &quot;good.summary&quot;)
            .update(roundedTemp);
    Metrics.distribution(COLLECTED\_METRIC\_NAMESPACE, &quot;good.&quot; + device)
            .update(roundedTemp);
} else {
    // Bad reading, output to side output, update counters
    c.sideOutput(badTag, c.element());
    Metrics.counter(COLLECTED\_METRIC\_NAMESPACE, &quot;bad.total&quot;).inc();
    Metrics.counter(COLLECTED\_METRIC\_NAMESPACE, &quot;bad.&quot; + device).inc();
}
```

Metrics that are created this way have names that have two parts: a _namespace_, and a _name_. In the example, the namespace is always the string `COLLECTED\_METRIC\_NAMESPACE (&quot;TemperatureSample&quot;)`, but a Java class can also be used as a namespace.

The values of the metrics are update-only in the Beam `PTransform` classes. The current value of a metric can be retrieved only by querying the `PipelineResult` after you submit the pipeline.

## Querying metrics in the application

In a Beam application, the [`Pipeline.run()`](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/Pipeline.html#run--) method that starts the application pipeline returns a [`PipelineResult`](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/PipelineResult.html) object, and the application can then call [`PipelineResult.metrics()`](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/PipelineResult.html#metrics--) to get a [`MetricsResults`](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/metrics/MetricResults.html) object if metrics are supported. The application can then use [`MetricsResult.queryMetrics()`](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/metrics/MetricResults.html#queryMetrics-org.apache.beam.sdk.metrics.MetricsFilter-) to query metrics that match a `MetricsFilter` object.

The `TemperatureSample` application periodically queries and prints metrics that the application created and updated:

```
PipelineResult result = pipeline.run();
...
    MetricResults metrics = result.metrics();
    MetricsFilter collectedFilter = MetricsFilter.builder()
      .addNameFilter(MetricNameFilter.inNamespace(COLLECTED\_METRIC\_NAMESPACE))
      .build();
    ...
        MetricQueryResults metricResults = metrics.queryMetrics(collectedFilter);
```

The counters and distributions from `COLLECTED\_METRIC\_NAMESPACE` are returned in response to this query.

The Streams Runner application can query metrics only while the application is running, not after it is completed, and can query only [`attempted()`](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/metrics/MetricResult.html#attempted--) results, not [`committed()`](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/metrics/MetricResult.html#committed--) results. It also can return metrics that were not added by the application directly but come from the Streams runtime. These metrics are in a namespace that starts with `com.ibm.streams` and includes operator metrics such as `nTuplesSubmitted` and `nTuplesProcessed`.

The Streams Runner uses the name of the Streams operator that implements the step as the step name. This name is usually the same as the name provided when the Beam pipeline is constructed, but might be modified slightly. For example, extra characters that are not allowed in Streams operator names might be removed, or the name might be changed slightly to make it unique. You can see the operator name in the Streams console.

## Viewing metrics in the Streams console and other tools

The Streams Runner exposes Beam metrics as Streams metrics, so they are visible to Streams tools such as the console, the REST API, or the JMX API. The Streams console is the easiest way to monitor Beam metrics.

In Beam, metrics are associated with steps in the pipeline execution. In Streams, the metrics are associated with the operator that corresponds to that step, and so the Beam metrics are available wherever Streams operator metrics are available.

For example, if you submit the `TemperatureSample` application and monitor the job in the Streams console by clicking on **Job Settings** and selecting **Show Full Graph**, the metrics are displayed when you hover over the `MergeReadings` operator in the **Streams Graph**.

This view shows both Beam metrics and Streams metrics. Beam metrics are named differently to distinguish them.

Beam counters in namespace _NS_ and with name _NAME_ are shown as Streams metrics with the name **BeamCounter::NS::NAME**, for example, ** BeamCounter::TemperatureSample::bad.total**.

`In short, need to talk to Queenie to see what her final decisions were based off our recommendations.  - Paul Gerver ???`

Beam distributions in namespace _NS_ and with name _DIST_ are associated with four separate Streams metrics, all starting with **BeamDistribution::NS::DIST **but ending with one of** ::count **,** ::sum **,** ::min **, or** ::max **, such as** BeamDistribution::TemperatureSample::good.device\_1::count**. From these values, the mean can be derived (that is, the sum divided by the count).

These names are an implementation detail of the Streams Runner and might change. If programmatic access to Beam metrics is required, the BEAM query API must be used.
