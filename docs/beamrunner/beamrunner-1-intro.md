You can use IBM® Streams Runner for Apache Beam to execute Apache Beam pipelines in an IBM Streams environment. A Beam application that is launched with Streams Runner is translated into a Streams Application Bundle (SAB) file. It is then optionally submitted to an IBM Streaming Analytics service in IBM Cloud or to a running IBM Streams domain and instance (Streams v4.2 or later).

To see what's new or improved in Streams Runner, see the [release notes](../release-notes). For information about the runner's Beam capabilities, see the [Beam capability matrix](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/).

For more information about Apache Beam, see the [Apache Beam documentation](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/).
