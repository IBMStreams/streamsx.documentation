You can use IBM® Streams Runner for Apache Beam to execute Apache Beam 2.0 pipelines in an IBM Streams environment. A Beam application that is launched with Streams Runner is translated into a Streams Application Bundle (SAB) file. It is then optionally submitted to an IBM Streaming Analytics service in IBM Bluemix or to an existing IBM Streams domain and instance.

For more information about Apache Beam, see the [Apache Beam documentation](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/).
