Installing IBM Streams Runner for Apache Beam involves downloading and extracting the Streams Runner toolkit, configuring environment variables, and creating a credentials file for your Streaming Analytics service.

## Prerequisites

A Red Hat Enterprise Linux V6 or V7 environment is required for compiling Beam applications that are submitted to the Streaming Analytics service in Bluemix.

## Creating a Streaming Analytics service on Bluemix

Before you can download Streams Runner, you must have a Streaming Analytics service so that you can open the Streams Console. For a video demonstration of creating the service, see [Creating a Streaming Analytics service on IBM Bluemix](https://ibm.box.com/s/fz0mq6plxuiqx8dfjtwenldyr6vopolz).

To create a Streaming Analytics service:

1. On the [Bluemix catalog](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/streaming-analytics/?cm_mc_uid=05407033353914938482142&amp;cm_mc_sid_50200000=) page, log in. If you don't yet have a Bluemix account, you can create one.
2. On the Bluemix dashboard page, click **Catalog**.
3. Use the **Filter** option to search for Streaming Analytics.
4. Click the **Streaming Analytics** service to configure an instance.
5. On the catalog page for the Streaming Analytics service, change **Service name** to something meaningful to you, for example, `Streaming Analytics-beam`.
6. Click **Create**. The service page opens and your service starts automatically. The service name appears as the title of the service page.

For more information about the Streaming Analytics service, see [Introduction to the Bluemix Streaming Analytics Service](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/streaming-analytics-now-available-bluemix-2/).

## Downloading and configuring Streams Runner

1. Launch the Streams Console:
    1. Navigate to the **Manage** tab of your Streaming Analytics Service.
    1. Click **Launch**.
1. Download Streams Runner:
    1. In the Streams Console, click **Help > Download > Download Streams Runner for Apache Beam**.
    1. Select **Save File**, specify a location if necessary, and click **OK**.
1. Extract the toolkit by entering the following command where you downloaded the file:
```
tar -zxvf com.ibm.streams.beam-2.0.0-beta.tar.gz
```
1. (Optional) Configure the environment variables. Although the variables are not required, the documentation refers to them for convenience. If you do not set the environment variables, you must use the full paths when you run the sample applications.

| Name | Description | Notes |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | STREAMS\_INSTALL | The path to the IBM Streams installation | Set by sourcing the `bin/streamsprofile.sh` file. This variable is already set in the Quick Start Edition. |
  | STREAMS\_RUNNER\_HOME | The path to the extraction location of the `com.ibm.streams.beam.tar.gz` file | Must be set by the user by using the `export` command. |
  | STREAMS\_BEAM\_TOOLKIT | The path to the Streams Runner toolkit (`$STREAMS\_RUNNER\_HOME/com.ibm.streams.beam`) | Set by using the `export` command. |
  | VCAP\_SERVICES | The path to the Bluemix credentials file. For more information about the credentials file, see [Creating a credentials file for your Streaming Analytics service](#creating-a-credentials-file-for-your-streaming-analytics-service). | Set by using the `export` command. |
  | STREAMING\_ANALYTICS\_SERVICE\_NAME | The path to the Bluemix credentials file. For more information about the credentials file, see [Creating a credentials file for your Streaming Analytics service](#creating-a-credentials-file-for-your-streaming-analytics-service). | Set by using the `export` command. |

## Validating the Streams Runner installation

The Streams Runner heavily relies on the `com.ibm.streams.beam` directory structure being preserved. To verify an installation, ensure that the translation and sdk JAR files appear as follows when you enter the following command:
`ls $STREAMS_BEAM_TOOLKIT/lib`

```
> com.ibm.streams.beam.sdk.jar  com.ibm.streams.beam.translation.jar
```

If the JAR files are not present, set `STREAMS_BEAM_TOOLKIT` to `<streams-runner-extraction-location>/com.ibm.streams.beam-1.0.0/com.ibm.streams.beam`

The Streams Runner directory tree structure

## Creating a credentials file for your Streaming Analytics service

To submit a Beam application to your Streaming Analytics service on Bluemix, you must create a JSON-formatted VCAP file that holds credentials and other information for the service. For a video demonstration of creating the credentials file, see [Creating a credentials file for the Streaming Analytics service on IBM Bluemix](https://ibm.box.com/s/qasw203e6gtdjpwu5ybmygcvstkr0xx8).

To create a VCAP file for an existing Streaming Analytics service:

1. Navigate to the folder where you installed the toolkit (`$STREAMS\_RUNNER\_HOME`) and copy the `template.vcap` file to a new file. Give the file a meaningful name and a file extension of `.vcap`.
2. Copy the credentials of your Streaming Analytics service:
  1. On the Streaming Analytics service page, click **Service credentials**.
  2. If necessary, create a credential by clicking **New credential**. Use the default information and click **Add**.
  3. Click **View credentials** for the credential that you want to use in your VCAP file. Click **Copy** to copy the credentials.
3. Paste the copied credentials into the VCAP file that you created, replacing the following line:  
    `<REMOVE THIS LINE AND INSERT CREDENTIALS HERE>`

   Tip: You can have multiple credentials in the same file, as shown in the following example. When you run Beam applications, you must identify which credentials are used by placing the name value into the `--serviceName` parameter. For example, `--serviceName="alternate-service"` uses the second set of credentials shown in the example.

   ```
    {
      "streaming-analytics" : [
        { "name" : "beam-service",
          "credentials" :
          <REMOVE THIS LINE AND INSERT CREDENTIALS HERE>
        },
        { "name" : "alternate-service",
          "credentials" :
          <REMOVE THIS LINE AND INSERT CREDENTIALS HERE>
        }
      ]
    }
  ```
