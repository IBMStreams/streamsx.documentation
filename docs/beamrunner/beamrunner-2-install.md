IBM速 Streams Runner for Apache Beam is installed by extracting the Streams Runner toolkit. You can extract the toolkit from your IBM Streams v4.3 or later installation or you can download a Streams Runner installation archive from an IBM Streaming Analytics service on IBM Cloud. Additional configuration steps are required, depending on which option you choose.

## Before you start: Develop your application
Apache Beam applications can be developed without Streams Runner being installed. For information about developing your Beam application, see the [Beam SDK for Java](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/java/) and its [Java SDK Quickstart](https://beam.apache.org/get-started/quickstart-java/).
