  title: Part 4 - Modularize your application 
---


This tutorial has barely scratched the surface of what
Streams is capable of. Apart from a very small number of SPL
expressions, no coding was involved in building a progressively more
interesting application.

With the help of a prepared but still simple additional module, this set
of applications can handle a continuous flow of live vehicle location
observations and distinguish between different kinds of content.

Simply by using a few building blocks, sketching a graph that governs
how the tuples flow, and setting some parameters in a property view,
you've already crafted a simple yet reasonably powerful solution.

## Next steps
After you complete the tutorial, your next steps are to decide whether:

-   This application development platform for streaming data can help
    you build solutions that enhance your business
-   What you have seen in this tutorial gives you a sense that it can help
    solve problems you already encounter
-   Your organization has access to the required development skills or
    should invest in building them
