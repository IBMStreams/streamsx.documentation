Learn basic SPL Concepts
------

If you are brand new to Streams, read the  [Basic Building Blocks](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/streams-quick-start-guide/#basic_building_blocks). **(Using this content as a placeholder for now.)**


Choose your IDE
------
Then, pick your development environment and walk through creating your own applications

- **Atom**
  {% include nav.html context="/docs/spl/atom/"%}
- **Streams Studio**

- **VSCode**


Where to find examples
--------------------

Once you have found an operator or toolkit you want to use, where can you find sample code?

-   **[The Streams samples catalog](https://ibmstreams.github.io/samples/)** is a searchable database of over 150 examples.

      ![catalog](/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/catalog.jpg)


      Click **Download zip** to download the sample, then import into your editor.

-  **Most toolkits on GitHub** will have a `samples` folder included in the release.  Download the toolkit release and import one or more of the samples into your IDE. Most toolkits will have information in the `README.md` on how to run the samples.


-   Search **[Streamsdev](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev)** for articles and tutorials, which often include samples.

Tips for creating SPL applications from scratch
-------

Now that you have followed a sample and are a bit familiar with the IDE, review these [guidelines on how to create your own applications](/streamsx.documentation/docs/spl/design)
