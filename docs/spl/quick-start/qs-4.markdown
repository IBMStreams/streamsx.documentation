Once you submit an application to run on an IBM Streams instance, there are tools available for monitoring the running application, or *job*.

The tool you use to monitor your application depends on the Streams version you are using, and/or your preference. 
 - [Monitoring a job using IBM Cloud Pak for Data](/streamsx.documentation/docs/spl/quick-start/qs-4a-cpd).

 - [Streams Console](/streamsx.documentation/docs/spl/quick-start/qs-4b-console), available in all Streams versions.

 - [Monitoring a job using the Streams extension for Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://ibmstreams.github.io/vscode-ide/docs/building-running-applications/#job-graph).
 
The functionality available in the VS Code extension is on par with that of Cloud Pak for Data, while the Streams Console provides a superset of these features, such as more fine-grained access to metrics.
