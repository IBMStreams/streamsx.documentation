This guide will help you get up and running with Streams and Streams Processing Language (SPL).

## 1. Run your first application

Learn how to compile and deploy a Streams application. You can run your application with a local installation of Streams or with Streams running in IBM Cloud or IBM Cloud Pak for Data.

  - **Option 1: Local installation**

    - Install the free [Streams Quick Start Edition](/streamsx.documentation/docs/4.3/qse-intro)
    - Next, [launch your first Streams application](/streamsx.documentation/docs/spl/quick-start/qs-1a) using Streams Studio

  - **Option 2: Use a Streams instance in the IBM Cloud, IBM Cloud Pak for Data, or standalone**
  
    - Install the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (VS Code) editor
    - Next, [launch your first Streams application](/streamsx.documentation/docs/spl/quick-start/qs-1b) using VS Code

## 2. Learn Streams Concepts

  Follow the [SPL Quick Start](/streamsx.documentation/docs/spl/quick-start/qs-2/) to learn how to create a Streams application from scratch using SPL.



## 3. Start developing your own application

  - ### Tips for creating SPL applications from scratch

    Now that you have followed a sample and are a bit familiar with the IDE, review these [guidelines on how to create your own applications](/streamsx.documentation/docs/spl/quick-start/qs-4).

  - ### Learn more about Streams Studio

    Complete the [Streams Studio tutorial](/streamsx.documentation/docs/spl/lab) to learn how to use the drag and drop editor in Streams Studio to create Streams applications.

  - ### Finding sample code

    Once you are more comfortable with SPL development, where can you find sample code to create your own applications?

    -   **[The Streams samples catalog](https://ibmstreams.github.io/samples/)** is a searchable database of over 150 examples.

          Click **Download zip** to download the sample, then import into your editor.

    -  **Most toolkits on GitHub** will have a `samples` folder included in the release.  Download the toolkit release and import one or more of the samples into your IDE. Most toolkits will have information in the `README.md` on how to run the samples.


    -   Search **[Streamsdev](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev)** for articles and tutorials, which often include samples.
