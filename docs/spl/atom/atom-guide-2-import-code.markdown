After configuring Atom, you can start working with some code.

To get the most out of this guide, it is a good idea to import the
sample application.

You can also go to the section that best
describes your use case:

-   [Import an existing project](/streamsx.documentation/docs/spl/atom/atom-guide-2-import-code/#import-an-existing-project) (including Streams Studio projects)

-   [Import a project from GitHub](/streamsx.documentation/docs/spl/atom/atom-guide-2-import-code/#import-a-project-from-github)

-   [Creating a new project in Atom](/streamsx.documentation/docs/spl/atom/atom-guide-2-import-code/#creating-a-new-project)


Import the sample project for this guide
-----------------------------------------

To follow along with this guide, download the BusAlerts application
archive. \[LINK\]

-   Unpack it into a folder

-   Import it into Atom: click **File** \> **Add Project Folder**.
    Browse to the project folder and click **Open.**

The following sections describe other ways to start development --
importing your own code from a file or GitHub, or creating a new
project.

Import an existing project
--------------------------

The same steps above apply to import any SPL project for use in Atom.

From Atom, click **File** \> **Add Project Folder**. Browse to the
project folder, and click **Open.**

Import a project from GitHub
----------------------------

If you have existing SPL code on Github**,** you can clone the
repository from within Atom:
From the Command Palette (_CMD + Shift + P_ on Mac), type **Github Clone**:

 ![git clone](/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/githubclone.jpeg)

Then paste the repository URL and click **Clone**.

 ![git clone uri](/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/github-clone-uri.jpeg)

The project should be added to the project pane.


Whether you imported an existing application or are creating one from
scratch, it is a good idea to explore the Atom editor to learn about
useful editing features.
