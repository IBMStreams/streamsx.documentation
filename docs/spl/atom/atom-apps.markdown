This development guide will cover using the [Atom editor](https://atom.io) to create and
develop applications written in Streams Processing Language (SPL).

Follow this guide if you want to learn about Streams and SPL without downloading and
installing the Streams platform.

To get started with Streams using a local installation, see the [Getting
Started with the Streams Quick Start Edition](/streamsx.documentation/docs/latest/qse-intro) page.

Prerequisites
-------------

If you are completely new to Streams, read the [Basic Building Blocks](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/streams-quick-start-guide/#basic_building_blocks) on Streamsdev for a basic introduction. Then you can return to this guide to:

-   Configure Atom for development

-   Run a sample application to see Streams in action

-   Create your own applications from scratch

**Note**: This guide will only cover creating Streams applications using
SPL. To learn about development in Python or Java, see the [Python development guide](/streamsx.documentation/docs/python/python-appapi-devguide/) or the [Java development guide](/streamsx.documentation/docs/java/java-appapi-devguide/).
