This development guide covers how to use the Atom editor to create and develop applications that are written in Streams Processing Language (SPL). You can download the [Atom editor](https://atom.io) from the atom.io website.

If you want to learn about Streams and SPL without setting up you own Streams environment, follow this guide. However, if you want to get started with Streams by using a local installation instead, see the [Getting Started with the Streams Quick Start Edition](/streamsx.documentation/docs/latest/qse-intro) page.

Prerequisites
-------------

If you are completely new to Streams, you can read the [Basic Building Blocks](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/streams-quick-start-guide/#basic_building_blocks) on Streamsdev for a basic introduction. Then you can return to this guide to complete the following tasks:

- Configure Atom for development.

- Run a sample application to see Streams in action.

- Create your own applications from scratch.

**Note**: This guide covers creating Streams applications by using
SPL. To learn about development in Python or Java&reg;, see the [Python development guide](/streamsx.documentation/docs/python/python-appapi-devguide/) or the [Java&reg; development guide](/streamsx.documentation/docs/java/java-appapi-devguide/).
