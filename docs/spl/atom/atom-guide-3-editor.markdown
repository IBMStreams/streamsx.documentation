This section covers some of the features in Atom that can be used when editing SPL code.

Atom overview
-----------------------------------------

* The **Project** pane shows the projects that you are currently working on. Use **File \> Add Project Folder** to import a project.

The Command Palette
--------------------

Open the command palette to see all the available commands.

![cmd palette](/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/cmd-palette.png)

If you looking for a pane, view or an action, search the command palette to find it.
For example, you can open the GitHub tab from the command palette, search for Git or GitHub tab and press the Enter key.

Version control with Git
-------------------------

The **Git** tab manages changes in your local repository and the **GitHub** tab helps you with projects that are hosted on GitHub.

![open git tab](/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/github-open.jpg)

Folders and files that are changed are also highlighted in the **Project** pane. For example, in the previous screen capture of the Git tab, the `SensorMonitor.spl` file has been changed (yellow) and the `output` folder has been added (green).

To learn more about Git support in Atom, see the [Atom Flight Manual section on Git](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/github-package/).

SPL editing features
--------------------

The editor has rich code completion and content assist features.

One of Atom's features is rich code completion and content assist. For example, open `my.name.space/BusAlerts_CachedData.spl` from the `BusAlerts` project.

Line 18 contains the line `composite BusAlertsCachedData`.

This composite is the _main composite_ of this application. It is the applicationâ€™s entry point.

Use this application to explore some of Atom's features.

#### Bracket matching

Bracket matching shows you the scope of a declaration:

![bracket-match](/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/brackets.jpg)

#### Code folding

If the closing bracket isn't easily visible, collapse portions of code, as shown in the following image:

<figure>
  <img src="/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/fold.gif" alt="code folding"/>
  <figcaption>Collapsing the composite shows the other functions that are defined in the SPL file.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Anywhere a down arrow ![caret](/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/caret.jpg) occurs, use it to collapse the code to make it easier to read.

View the documentation for an operator
--------------------------------
You can hover over any artifact, such as a parameter, stream, or operator, and its documentation is displayed if it is available.

For example, the first operator in the application is a `FileSource` operator. Hover over the operator to see its documentation:

![fsrc-doc](/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/hover.gif)

This operator reads data from a file and produces a stream of tuples that represents the data that was in the file.

The **param** clause is a list of named parameters of the operator, such as the `file` parameter that specifies the name of the file.

Hover over the `initDelay` parameter to see what it does.

Find references within a file
------------------------------
To find out where a stream or operator is used within a file, you can click on it to highlight occurrences. For example, a stream called `NextBusData_FromFile` is the output of the preceeding `FileSource` operator. Click the `NextBusData_FromFile` stream to highlight occurrences:

![found occurences](/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/ocurrences.jpg)

Find references within a project
------------------------------------

Use **Find References** to find where an artifact is used within the whole project.

Continuing the preceding example, the `NextBusData_FromFile` stream is used by the `ParseNextBusData` operator. To see where the `ParseNextBusData` operator is defined, right click and select **Find References** from the menu.

![find refs](/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/refs.gif)

This action opens the **Symbol References** pane, which lists all references of this operator, including its definition. Click on a result in that pane to go to the corresponding file.

**Note:** The **Go to Declaration** menu item is unsupported due to a
limitation in Atom.

Code completion
-----------------

The editor also supports code completion. As you type, you can press `CTRL+SPACE` to show a list of suggestions:

![Content assist](/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/contentassist.gif)

The preceding screen capture shows the list of parameters available for the `FileSource` operator.

Operator Templates
---------------------

You can also add operators by using templates.

Imagine that instead of the `FileSource` operator, you want to use the `HDFS2FileSource` operator to read data from Hadoop.

To add a new `HDFS2FileSource` operator to your graph, type `CTRL + SPACE` on an empty line and search the available operator templates for *hdfs*:

![operator template content assist](/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/template.gif)

A template exists, so use the down arrows to select *HDFS2FileSource for IBM Analytics Engine* and hit press the Enter key:
The template for the operator is added to the file. Change the operator's parameters, stream type, and output type to suit your needs.


Finding problems
---------------------

The lower left corner of the editor shows any compilation or syntax errors in your code:

![errors list](/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/error-list.jpg)

To find and fix the errors, click the error icon to open the **Diagnostics** pane.

![errors pane](/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/errors.jpg)

You can also open all files with errors at the same time by typing "diagnostics errors" from the Command Palette:

![Open all errors](/streamsx.documentation/images/atom/jpg/open-all-errors.jpg)


Summary
---------

*  Open the command palette to access all panes and actions in Atom.
* `CTRL + SPACE` shows code completion suggestions at any time.
* `ESC` dismisses the suggestions that appear.


Next Steps
----------------------

Now that you have covered the Atom editor basics, you can run the [sample BusAlerts application](/streamsx.documentation/docs/spl/atom/atom-guide-5-build) or continue to the next section to [create your own application](/streamsx.documentation/docs/spl/atom/atom-guide-4-create).
