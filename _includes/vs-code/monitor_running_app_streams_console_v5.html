    <div>
      You can look at the data on a given stream to observe the data that is being processed or produced by an operator. For example, the <code>Quotes</code> operator produces a stream of stock quotes. Letâ€™s take a look at the data.

      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>In the <strong>Application Dashboard</strong>, find the <strong>Streams Graph</strong> card and expand it.</li>
          <li>Hover over the stream that comes out of the <code>Quotes</code> operator and right-click.</li>
          <li>Select <strong>Create Dashboard View</strong>.</li>
          <li>Accept the default options and click on the <strong>OK</strong> button.</li>
          <li>Minimize the <strong>Streams Graph</strong> card.</li>
          <li>A new card is created in the dashboard that displays the tuples in the stream produced by the <code>Quotes</code> operator. Notice that the view is processed as new data arrives.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
