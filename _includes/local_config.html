    <h4>Submit to  Streams v4.2 or v4.3</h4>

Use these steps if Streams is installed locally, or if you are using the Streams Quick Start Edition (QSE).

<p>If you are using the Streams Quick Start Edition, you do not have to modify the  code as it uses the default instance and domain ids.</p>

<p>Otherwise, make sure that the <code>STREAMS_INSTANCE_ID</code> and <code>STREAMS_DOMAIN_ID</code> are set to match  your installation.</p>

<h5>Copy this code snippet:</h5>
    
{% highlight python %}
from streamsx.topology import context
os.environ["STREAMS_INSTANCE_ID"]= "StreamsInstance" # change as needed
os.environ["STREAMS_DOMAIN_ID"]= "StreamsDomain" # change as needed
# These environment variables should be set as needed

# os.environ["STREAMS_INSTALL"] =  # Location of a IBM Streams installation (4.2 or 4.3).
# os.environ["STREAMS_ZKCONNECT"] = # (optional) ZooKeeper connection string (when not using an embedded ZooKeeper)
# os.environ["STREAMS_USERNAME"] = # (optional) User name to submit the job as
