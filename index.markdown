The streamsx.documentation is a community-based documentation project for IBM Streams.
The goal of the project is to provide easy-to-follow documentation and development guides to help users get started with Streams.

## Getting started with IBM Streams


Streams applications can be developed in Python, Java, and the Streams Processing Language (SPL). 

The following are resources to help you get started developing applications using your language of choice.

### Developing Streams applications with Python

{: .simple}
* [Development guide for Python applications](/streamsx.documentation/docs/python/1.6/python-appapi-devguide/)
* [API reference](https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
* [Older releases](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.topology/releases)



### Developing Streams applications with SPL


Streams Processing Language is specifically designed for creating Streams applications. You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or Streams Studio to get started.  Streams Studio provides a full IDE with a graphical drag-and-drop editor.
