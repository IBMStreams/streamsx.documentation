## Developing Streams applications

Streams applications can be developed in Python, Java, Scala, and the Streams Processing Language (SPL). In addition, you can create applications using the Apache Beam programming model and deploy them on the Streams runtime.

The following are resources to help you get started developing applications using your language and model of choice.

### Developing Streams applications with SPL

## Integrating with Streams
There are dozens of toolkits available to help you integrate Streams with popular systems like [HDFS](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.hdfs) [HBase](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.hbase), [Kafka](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.kafka), and more.
Some toolkits are included with Streams, and others are [available on Github](https://github.com/ibmstreams).
