The streamsx.documentation is a community-based documentation project for IBM Streams.
The goal of the project is to provide easy-to-follow documentation and development guides to help users get started with Streams.

## Developing Streams applications

Streams applications can be developed in Python, Java, Scala, and the Streams Processing Language (SPL). In addition, you can create applications using the Apache Beam programming model and deploy them on the Streams runtime.

The following are resources to help you get started developing applications using your language and model of choice.
