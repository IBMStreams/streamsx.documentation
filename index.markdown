The streamsx.documentation is a community-based documentation project for IBM Streams.
The goal of the project is to provide easy-to-follow documentation and development guides to help users get started with Streams.

## Getting started with IBM Streams


Streams applications can be developed in Python, Java, and the Streams Processing Language (SPL). 

The following are resources to help you get started developing applications using your language of choice.

### Developing Streams applications with Python

{: .simple}
* [Development guide for Python applications](/streamsx.documentation/docs/python/1.6/python-appapi-devguide/)
* [API reference](https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
* [Older releases](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.topology/releases)



### Developing Streams applications with SPL


Streams Processing Language is specifically designed for creating Streams applications. You can use Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or Atom, or Streams Studio to get started.  Streams Studio provides a full IDE with a graphical drag-and-drop editor.


{: .simple}

- [Developing for IBM Cloud or IBM Cloud Pak for Data using Atom/VS Code](/streamsx.documentation/docs/spl/atom/atom-apps/). (*No download required.*)

- [Developing with a local installation of Streams](/streamsx.documentation/docs/4.3/qse-intro).

## Integrating with Streams
There are dozens of toolkits available to help you integrate Streams with popular systems like [HDFS](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.hdfs) [HBase](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.hbase), [Kafka](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.kafka), and more.
Some toolkits are included with Streams, and others are [available on Github](https://github.com/ibmstreams).
